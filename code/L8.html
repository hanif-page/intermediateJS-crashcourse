        // Conclusion: 
        // - APIs are functions exposed by a software. We use APIs to interact with the software.
        // - Programming APIs are consumed within the programming language itself, wheres Web APIs are consumed via HTTP.
        // - HTTP comes with 2 part -> the request and response. Request is sent by the browser, meanwhile Response is sent by the server.
        // - HTTP header contain meta data about the request/response, while the HTTP body contains the payload.
